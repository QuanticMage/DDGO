//"To use a 3-resistance piece in your armor setup, you need another piece of the same type with enough upgrades. Aim for around 350 to 380 upgrades across both pieces.
//For example, if your helmet lacks fire resistance, pair it with boots that cover all four resistances. Ensure the combined resistances on both pieces sum to 82% with the set bonus. Upgrade the 3-resistance piece to 35% and the other piece to 23% on its three resistances, with the missing one reaching 58%. "
