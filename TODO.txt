* (DONE)Add in options for 'best' rating (Hide <4 armor, hide equipment)

* Display move speed and size (items/pets/accessories)
* Display stats for rating and side (make clearer)
* Let the user upload a save without refreshing
* Save settings via cookies.  Exclude certain item types.
* Diamonds + Hearts show up as turtle treadmills and clog up everything
* Tower -> Builder   Minions = Builder Summoner

* Hero Boost Monk

Examples (should factor in resistances for TB/Upper/Jester/DPS):
AB1 (Tower Boost/Upgrader)
AB2 Specced DPS (monk) - AB2 with HDMG side
GW (gunwitch) - HDMG with TDMG and rate sides (icy needly is TRANGE with HDMG side)
AB1 DPS (warden) - HDMG with AB1 side
AB2 DPS (huntress) - HDMG with AB2 side
AB1 + AB2 DPS (countess) - HDMG with AB1 and AB2 sides
HP (summoner) - HP

Bugs:

* (DONE)"Temp Name"
* (DONE)Figure out why off by 1 sometimes
* Template name someitmes in ()s  Retanizer (EvilEye full template)
