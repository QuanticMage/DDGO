** Tower rate seems to never be grey, or columns aren't refreshed when you change stars (Theoran's video)
** Fully upgrade doesn't upgrade resist view
** Fully upgrade needs to recalculate when you change rating

Rating mode doesn't automatically select?
Hover tips should show up on builder app stuff but not on equipment pieces after.

//Upper jester is just Cast Rate+Res w/ HHP as a side?
//yeah, also want 3726 ab2 (wheel max) and ideally 0 trange but thats optional

Hover over "App Builder" etc shows build order for primary stats
Make sure when you switch order it refreshes the upgrade stuff
Damage simulator
