“Stars show how good this item is at what it does best.
Weak stats don’t lower the rating.”

Hover over color for value
Filter based on quality of armor

Something I think that is worth mentioning is the possibility of a hero wanting negative stats
In this case a Jester


So to be clear-- you would like it to show the rating of the set it would be best for, not the currently selected one (price already behaves like this)

yea i would want it to have a sort toggle that shows its best rating in combination with its pirce and "Best for"
just to give an idea of how good it is without needing to click around

that makes sense.  The biggest reason I didnt' have something like that is that the ratings aren't on the same scale between pieces;  TRange sets have ratings much lower than Builder App for instance.
I can make another category which is just "Show Best Rating" maybe (on the row with Builder App, Gunwitch, etc)

well you could sort by estimated value and then just have rating on the side

* Glass + Defenders set => Events

* Plate should come after Pristine on the filter list\
* Gauntlet should come before Torso

also is it possible for like weapons and pet dps to maybe somehow get added? It would be really cool to see how much x dps weapon or pet is worth and to know what you have
I dont wanna sound super demanding or anything. This tool is very useful and I'm glad it now exists.

* 3-piece resistances 
//"To use a 3-resistance piece in your armor setup, you need another piece of the same type with enough upgrades. Aim for around 350 to 380 upgrades across both pieces.
//For example, if your helmet lacks fire resistance, pair it with boots that cover all four resistances. Ensure the combined resistances on both pieces sum to 82% with the set bonus. Upgrade the 3-resistance piece to 35% and the other piece to 23% on its three resistances, with the missing one reaching 58%. "
