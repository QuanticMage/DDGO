TODO:

PRIORITY
* Show upgrades (+x) over the stats, how many upgrades went into resistances on the hero pane when hovering
* Update auto-event identification code.  include bCantBesold (glass + defenders sets to event items, but not in list?)
* Filter layout iteration- make it easier
* Fix test characters, make them real Heroes rather than broken 
* Pet damage
* Pets / Weapons in 'equip best'
* Display and sorting by weapon and pet stats (Size, move speed, etc)
* Add a warning when your hero has stats spec'd into something other than your build
* Rarity and pricing analysis
* Total events at top row of event list
* Update export to include more stat columns


BUGS and COMPATIBILITY
* The custom field has priority or is ignoring the "other" filters (other equipped characters)
* Crystal Cane broken
* Weird striping on table
* Warn if no set bonus
* Santa hat
* Close event modal on mouse down not mouse up
* "Firefox users should click the padlock and clear site cache if you are having problems" under a Firefox notes popup
* Zooming messes up selection (Firefox)
* Opera - remove button
* Brave - why won't it save between sessions
* Safari - test


FEATURES TO CONSIDER
* Setting for not enforcing level limits on characters
* Save filter text between runs
* Consider redoing filters to make them easier to use
* Resists>Tdmg>Hhp>>>AB2>Hdmg - JitB barb
* Upper jester is just Cast Rate+Res w/ HHP as a side? 3726 ab2 (wheel max) and ideally 0 trange but thats optional
* Anything labeled as 5,10 or 15cv gets added so you can see your net RAW CV
* Respect / hide <color> tags
* Currency badge  - coal + frags + zamiras + mana tokens / raw mana - include known cv value?
* Right click menu to "Exclude from search" (Extra filter tile w/ hover?) for location and individual items
* Fix hover highlight- different color than selected?
* Mana value mode
* Pricing for ult accessories (25cv for ult, 50cv over cap?)
* Show achievement list and missing achievements for different badges
* Better examples- quality filter, negating searches, searching negative stats

BACK END
* Add in : ProtonChargeBlastDamageMultiplier to Equipment data
* ExtraEquipmentColorMultiplier=> consider for calculating color
* Add in MAXHP calculator
* SeqAct_GiveEquipment analysis
* Use loops for rows
* Use GetMergedProperties instead of my walking manually?
